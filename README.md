jExam is an exam generation tool that uses Jupyter Notebooks to create multiple versions of interactive exams based on a master Jupyter Notebook. jExam is a fork of [jAssign](https://github.com/okpy/jassic) and [Otter Assign](https://otter-grader.rtfd.io) that uses raw cells in notebooks to define questions with multiple versions, allowing instructors to create anywhere from a few different versions of an exam to an individual versions per student (provided enough questions and versions) for the purpose of preventing illicit collaboration on exams.
